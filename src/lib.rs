//! A pure-Rust LDAP library using the Tokio stack.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! In `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.ldap3]
//! version = "0.6"
//! ```
//!
//! In the crate root (`src/lib.rs` or `src/main.rs`):
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate ldap3;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Summary
//!
//! The library provides both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces. The
//! [`LdapConn`](struct.LdapConn.html) structure is the starting point for all synchronous operations.
//! [`LdapConnAsync`](struct.LdapConnAsync.html) is its asynchronous analogue, and [`Ldap`](struct.Ldap.html) is
//! the low-level asynchronous connection handle used by both.
//!
//! In the [struct list](#structs), async-related structs have an asterisk (__*__) after
//! the short description.
//!
//! Since the library is still in development, none of the interfaces should be considered
//! stable. If a breaking change of some component is planned, it will be noted in the
//! documentation with a bolded __Note__, and a link to the GitHub issue discussing the
//! change, if applicable. General, crate-level issues with the documentation can be
//! discussed [here](https://github.com/inejge/ldap3/issues/3).
//!
//! The documentation is written for readers familiar with LDAP concepts and terminology,
//! which it won't attempt to explain.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! The following two examples perform exactly the same operation and should produce identical
//! results. They should be run against the example server in the `data` subdirectory of the crate source.
//! Other sample programs expecting the same server setup can be found in the `examples` subdirectory.
//!
//! ### Synchronous search
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! extern crate ldap3;
//!
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! use ldap3::{LdapConn, Scope, SearchEntry};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     match do_search() {
//!         Ok(_) => (),
//!         Err(e) => println!("{}", e),
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn do_search() -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
//!     let ldap = LdapConn::new("ldap://localhost:2389")?;
//!     let (rs, _res) = ldap.search(
//!         "ou=Places,dc=example,dc=org",
//!         Scope::Subtree,
//!         "(&(objectClass=locality)(l=ma*))",
//!         vec!["l"]
//!     )?.success()?;
//!     for entry in rs {
//!         println!("{:?}", SearchEntry::construct(entry));
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Asynchronous search
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! extern crate futures;
//! extern crate ldap3;
//! extern crate tokio_core;
//!
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! use futures::Future;
//! use ldap3::{LdapConnAsync, Scope, SearchEntry};
//! use tokio_core::reactor::Core;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     match do_search() {
//!         Ok(_) => (),
//!         Err(e) => println!("{}", e),
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn do_search() -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
//!     let mut core = Core::new()?;
//!     let handle = core.handle();
//!     let ldap = LdapConnAsync::new("ldap://localhost:2389", &handle)?;
//!     let srch = ldap.and_then(|ldap|
//!         ldap.search(
//!             "ou=Places,dc=example,dc=org",
//!             Scope::Subtree,
//!             "(&(objectClass=locality)(l=ma*))",
//!             vec!["l"]
//!         ))
//!         .and_then(|response| response.success())
//!         .and_then(|(rs, _res)| Ok(rs));
//!     let rs = core.run(srch)?;
//!     for entry in rs {
//!         println!("{:?}", SearchEntry::construct(entry));
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

pub mod controls {
  //! Control construction and parsing.
  //!
  //! A control can be associated with a request or a response. Several common
  //! controls, such as [`PagedResults`](struct.PagedResults.html), are implemented
  //! directly by this library. If an implemented control has the same form for
  //! the request and the response, there will be a single structure for both.
  //! (This is the case for `PagedResults`.) If the response control is different,
  //! its name will consist of the request control name with the `Resp` suffix.
  //!
  //! A request control can be created by instantiating its structure and converting
  //! it to ASN.1 with `into()` when passing the instance or constructing the request
  //! control vector in the call to [`with_controls()`](../struct.LdapConn.html#method.with_controls).
  //! A third-party control must implement the conversion from an instance
  //! of itself to [`RawControl`](struct.RawControl.html), a general form of control.
  //!
  //! `RawControl`, together with an optional instance of [`ControlType`](types/index.html),
  //! forms the type [`Control`](struct.Control.html); a vector of `Control`s is part
  //! of the result of all LDAP operation which return one.
  //!
  //! The first element of `Control` will have a value if the parser recognizes
  //! the control's OID as one that is implemented by the library itself. Since the
  //! list of implemented controls is expected to grow, matching those values must
  //! be done through reexported types in the [`types`](types/index.html) module,
  //! and cannot be exhaustive.
  //!
  //! A recognized response control can be parsed by calling
  //! [`parse()`](struct.RawControl.html#method.parse) on the instance of `RawControl`
  //! representing it. A third-party control must implement the
  //! [`ControlParser`](trait.ControlParser.html) trait to support this interface.

  //! one for constructing requests, and another for parsing responses. If request and
  //! response are the same, there is only the request struct; if they are different,
  //! the response struct's name will consist of the request struct name with the
  //! `Resp` suffix.
  //!
  //! A request struct must implement the `From` conversion of itself into `Exop`.
  //! A response struct must implement the [`ExopParser`](trait.ExopParser.html)
  //! trait.
